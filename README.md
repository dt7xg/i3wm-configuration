# My Workspace Dotfiles Repository

Contains my personal configuration files for the following:

- **URxvt Terminal**
  - `.Xresources` file
  - `.Xresources.d` directory

- **i3 Window Manager**
  - `i3` directory

- **i3blocks Status Bar**
  - `i3blocks` directory
  
- **Background**
  - `Pictures` directory

## Usage

1. **URxvt Terminal Configuration**
   - Copy the contents of `.Xresources` to your home directory (`~`).
   - Place any additional configuration files in the `.Xresources.d` directory.
   - Reload your x session with "xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources" to apply changes.

2. **i3 Window Manager Configuration**
   - Copy the contents of the `i3` directory to your i3 configuration directory (usually `~/.config/i3/`).
   - Reload your i3.

3. **i3blocks Status Bar Configuration**
   - Copy the contents of the `i3blocks` directory to your i3blocks configuration directory (usually `~/.config/i3blocks/`).

## Additional Notes
- Customize the configurations based on your preferences.

**Note:** These are my personal configurations. Feel free to cherry-pick what suits you and leave what doesn't. It's your setup â€“ make it your own!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
